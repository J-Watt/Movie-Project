# FRESH TOMATOES

Udacity
Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree: project one
By Jordan Alexander Watt

Fresh Tomatoes and Entertainment Center is an application designed to generate
a simple html webpage which hosts information about your favourite movies. This
project was created for the first assignment in Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree.


## Quick Start

Open "fresh_tomatoes.html" using a web browser. To generate a new 
"fresh_tomatoes.html" run "entertainment_center.py". 
See usage below for more details.


## What's Included

Movie Website
* Entertainment_center.py
* Fresh_tomatoes.html
* Fresh_tomatoes.py
* media.py
* README.md


## Usage

**Note:**
Python 3 needed to run '.py' files.

###HTML file:
	A default "fresh_tomatoes.html" is included in the folder and can be run
	completely by itself using a web browser. To generate a new
	"fresh_tomatoes.html" simply run "entertainment_center.py". 

###To Customize:
	Open and edit "entertainment_center.py" and change the variables used in
	the list "movies". Use strings for the movie properties in the order;
	"Title", "Synopsis", "Cast", "Image Url", "Youtube Url", "IMDB Url".
	
	When complete, run "entertainment_center.py" and a new html file titled
	"fresh_tomatoes.html" will be generated in the same directory. This new
	file will contain all of the new films and their attributes.
